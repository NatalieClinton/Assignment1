## Changes Made

On the 'index.html' file, semantic elements were added to help the search engines and other user devices determine the importance and context of the Horiseon web page. 

On the 'style.css' file, redundant styles were condensed and labeled for ease while editing which make changes to the design and debugging simpler to access.
